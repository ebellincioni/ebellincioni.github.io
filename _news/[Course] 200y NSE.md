I participated in the <a href="https://gdr-turbulence.universite-lyon.fr/summer-school-2023-265651.kjsp">200 Years of Navier-Stokes & Turbulences</a> summer school organised by <a href="https://www.houches-school-physics.com/ecole-de-physique-des-houches/home-ecole-les-houches-1066564.kjsp">Ã‰cole de Physique Des Houches</a> (FR). The school lasted 1 month and included lectures about turbulence from scientists and professors among the best in the field.
