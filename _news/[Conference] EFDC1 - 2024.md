With this edition, the European Turbulence Conference (ETC) and European Fluid Mechanics Conference (EFMC) were merged, giving rise to the First European Fluid Dynamics Conference (<a href="https://efdc1.de/">EFDC1</a>), held in Aachen (DE). There, I presented my work on the melting dynamics of floating ice cylinders.
