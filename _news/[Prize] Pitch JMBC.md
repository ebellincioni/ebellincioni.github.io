The Organising committee of the yearly JMBC meeting (the Burgers Symposium, held in Lunteren (NL)) awarded me with the Best Poster and Pitch prize. The selection criteria were: (1) design of the presentation, (2) scientific content and (3) clarity in which the message is delivered in the pitch and poster. My poster and 1-minute pitch were selected among ~30 submissions. Hereafter you can see my design that won.
