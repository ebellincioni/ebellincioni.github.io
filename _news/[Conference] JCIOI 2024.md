The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jcioi/home">Joint Commision for Ice-Ocean Interactions (JCIOI)</a> organises bi-yearly online workshops on Ice-ocean interactions. I participated and presented my work on the meelting dynamics of floating ice cylinders. The interactions with that community that followed my talk strengthened my belief for a fruitful exchange of knowledge and insights between different communities.
