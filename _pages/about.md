I am a physicist, working on fluid dynamics.

At this time, I am working on my PhD with <a href="https://www.shuisman.com/">Sander Husiman</a> and <a href="https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/">Detlef Lohse</a> on the melting of moving objects. So far, we have worked on the melting of unconstrained, floating ice cylinders (see <a href="/projects/floatingCylinder/">here</a>) and on the melting of ice spheres in high levels of turbulence (see <a href="/projects/sphere/">here</a>). Recently, we started to get interested in the lubricating effect of the meltlayer on a melting object. 

As an early-career fluid dynamicists, I am trying to diversify my interests to cover a wide range of fluid dynamics phaenomena. It is under this light that my choice of working with low and high Reynolds number flows has to be seen. Or, similarly, my will to share my work with oceanographers and glaciologists, to learn how my idealised laboratory work can help their fields, and to get inspiration for a next project. 

My <i>forma mentis </i> is the one that I have acquired during my Physics studies: I strive to summarize observations using explanatory and predictive theories.  I aim to delve into fundamental processes, rather than into how these reveal themselves in incidental manifestations. 

<!-- On a more general note, I am interested in the philosophy of science. From my standpoint, it is fundamental for a researcher to understand all the <i> whys </i> around the methods, procedures, conventions, habits, (...) around their work. I find that researchers should be asking themselves questions not only about the subject matter, but also about the consequences of their own choices. In the end, isn't asking questions what research is all about?  -->
