Niels's Bachelor thesis project started off from an observation of a ''defective'' ice ball melting in our <a href="/projects/sphere"> dodecahedron setup </a>. The sphere had an equatorial groove, and <a href="https://www.shuisman.com/">Sander Husiman</a> and I developed a project to investigate how would the groove evolve throughout the melting time. Hence, Niels casted grooved ice balls out of silicon moulds, and melted them under isotropic turbulence in the dodecahedron. He imaged the melting balls, and measured the time evolution of the shape of their grooves, and linked it to the particle's Reynolds number.
