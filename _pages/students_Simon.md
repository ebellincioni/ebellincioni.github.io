Simon did his Bachelor thesis project with me and <a href="https://www.shuisman.com/">Sander Husiman</a>, performing experiments on the problem of melting on an inclined heated ramp. He started off using paraffine wax, which is solid at melting temperature, and continued using ice blocks in a walk-in fridge. He measured the melt rate and velocity of the blocks as a function of the angle of inclination and surface temperature of the inclined ramp.
