Yiyu did an internship with me and <a href="https://www.shuisman.com/">Sander Husiman</a> while he was a student at the University of Science and Technology of China in Heifei. He worked gathering useful data on the <a href="/projects/sphere"> melting of ice balls in turbulence</a>, measuring the melt rate and the shape evolution of spheres that are held in place in the centre of our dodecahedron setup. From the melt rate, he extracted a Nusselt number and investigated its scaling with the particle's Reynolds number.
